# Prisma Schema and TypeScript Fixes Report

## Date: 2025-01-04

## Issue Summary
The TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`) was failing due to mismatches between the Prisma schema and the TypeScript code. Many models and fields referenced in the code didn't exist in the schema.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. Missing Models
Added the following models to the Prisma schema:
- `CommentModerationLog` - for tracking comment moderation actions
- `CommentReaction` - for user reactions on comments
- `CommentReport` - for user reports on inappropriate comments
- `BannedWord` - for managing prohibited words
- `AIModerationSettings` - for AI moderation configuration
- `AICommentAnalysis` - for storing AI analysis results
- `AIModerationLog` - for tracking AI moderation decisions

### 3. Code Fixes

#### Daily Doses API
Fixed model name usage:

## Migration Requirements
After these schema changes, you'll need to:
1. Create a Prisma migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-missing-models-and-fields`
2. Apply the migration to your database
3. Ensure all team members pull the latest changes and run migrations

## Result
✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` now passes successfully
✅ Prisma schema now matches the application code requirements
